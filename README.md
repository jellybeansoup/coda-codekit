# CodeKit Plugin for Coda 2

This plugin aims to integrate Coda 2 with CodeKit, allowing for a more streamlined workflow when building projects. It does this by providing some basic hooks into CodeKit's functionality via menu options (and thus, keyboard shortcuts), and allowing for some automated responses to actions within the editor.
